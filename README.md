# StartupCMD - Setup guide and information

StartupCMD is a little project that I created just for my own needs of running some commands at startup in order to get everything I want up and running. Specificly, Dolby Atmos was allways disabling itself at startup so I created this and configured it to run a command to turn Dolby Atmos back on each time I turned the PC on. This is not in constant development but if you have any suggestions I am all ears!

In this file will be available the information needed to setup and execute the app.

## Requirements
* Python 3 and above instalation
* Microsoft Windows 7 or above 


## Setup guide
1. **Download the files** from the repository.
2. Drag **StartupCMD.pyw** to the `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` directory.
3. Open the **Settings.py** script and follow the instructions to set up new commands.
